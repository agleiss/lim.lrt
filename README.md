# Left-Inflated Mixture model Likelihood Ratio Test (LIM-LRT)

A special characteristic of data from molecular biology is the frequent occurrence of zero intensity values which can arise either by true absence of a compound or by a signal that is below a technical limit of detection.
While so-called two-part tests compare mixture distributions between groups, one-part tests treat the zero-inflated distributions as left-censored. The left-inflated mixture model combines these two approaches. 
Assuming a log-normal subdistribution the left-inflated mixture model provides estimates for the proportions of the two considered types of zero intensities.
